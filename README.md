<h3>Demo</h3>
<p><a href="https://pitambersingh.com/javascript-plugins/javascript-custom-tabs/" target="_blank">Demo Link</a></p>

<p>This project demonstrates the implementation of custom tabs using vanilla JavaScript. The tabs dynamically switch between different sections of content, providing a clean and interactive user interface.</p>

<h3>Features</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Dynamic Tab Switching: Each tab displays different content without reloading the page.</li>
	<li>Responsive Design: The tabs are fully responsive and work across all devices.</li>
	<li>Lightweight: The project is built using pure JavaScript, HTML5, and CSS3 with no external dependencies.</li>
	<li>Accessible: The tab component is designed with accessibility in mind, allowing keyboard navigation and proper ARIA attributes.</li>
</ul>
